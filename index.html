        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          My name is Boone, and I love living life to the fullest and sharing my joys with others. That is why I was drawn to web design, 
          because I can make things beautiful for all to see! When I'm not getting pettings from my owners, playing with my sister Ridley, 
          or chasing the housecats through the house, I can be found barking and boofing out code for all of my canine companions. This
          website is a portfolio of my latest projects. Wanna know why hiring a pup like me is the right decision for your company? See
          for yourself!</p>

          <h3>Project 1: Paws For Thought</h3>

          <p>
            When you're an Aussie like me, it's easy to get too wound up. This 
            can lead to disaster...or at least lots of scolding from our beloved
            humans. Take a moment to "paws" for thought and meditate, and maybe...just maybe...we can 
            restrict our wildest fantasies to the backyard!

          <h3>Project 2: The Great CAT-astrophe</h3>

          <p>
            Chasing cats is a beloved pasttime, especially since we
            truly love our feline brothers and sisters! They continue to lounge
            around us, as they know we mean well. But their faces are still
            hilarious as they scamper away! Enjoy these photos :)

          <h3>Project 3: Aussies Do It Better</h3>

          <p>
            Oh yeah. That's right. I'm boofing my horn ;) Our humans get 
            Facebook to show off. We need a website, too! Here's a site with 
            pages of submissions of photos from Aussies like me and you, so 
            that we can celebrate one another!
